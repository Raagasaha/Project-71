    <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">The food options and responsibilities to consider, canteens must be better organized and more efficent than they have been in the past. Online menus with photographs of the meals prepared, and detailed descriptions of their ingredients help both students and parents make the right nutritional choices. Each student of staff member who acceses the canteen could be provided with a School Canteen Account on the school website that keeps track of their previous meal choices and any dietary requirements they may have. Ordering online by ticking a box and paying for meals online can eliminate all the fuss of money handling, making it safer and less complicated for staff and students alike. Here again, diversity is the key.</p>

It saves money by putting and end to innacurate time reporting, buddy punching, tardiness, time abuse, and overpayment. As a matter of fact, a study done by Assium Group found that large orginazations save up to $1,600 per employee after implementing automated attendance managment systems.
    <br>
    3. Productivity / Efficiency
    Monitoring and managing attendance manually can be time-consuming, laborious, and an expensive affair. It takes time to process paper sheets and time cards, create schedules, authorize leave and overtime, and create payrell manually. Free up precious administration time with an automated system that does it all for you, from keeping track of employee hours to automatically importing info into your payroll system. The time and effort save combined with data accuracy helps in optimizinh the use of resources which lead to increased productivity and improves profits.
